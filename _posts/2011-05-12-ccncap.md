ccncap is now available for order. It uses the same interface as ssncap and retains the same features, but is made to find valid Credit Card Numbers being sent unprotected over the network. All the same 
[examples](/security/ssncap/documentation#examples) and [documentation](/security/ssncap/documentation) for ssncap work for ccncap. Simply replace the &#8216;ssncap&#8217; command with &#8216;ccncap&#8217;.

Ensure your applications are not revealing sensitive information over the network. [Order ccncap](/security/ssncap/order) and take an active role in monitoring your network traffic.
